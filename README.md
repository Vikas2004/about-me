## Repository Links

* [Repository](https://github.com/Vikas2004/about-me)
* [Hosted Web Page]()


This is a simple repo created to learn more about using how git commands work both locally and on cloud.

* In order to get started we will have to **create** an **account** in the **github** initially which will allow us to create repositories in order for us to save our work in it.

* Next we need to install **git** to our local machine which can be done through choclecty, but we need other tools to be installed so as to work swiftly on git. 


This is my favourite Picture.
