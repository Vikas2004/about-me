## About:
This is a simple repo created to learn more about using how git commands work both locally and on cloud.

* In order to get started we will have to **create** an **account** in the **github** initially which will allow us to create repositories in order for us to save our work in it.

* Next we need to install **git** to our local machine which can be done through choclecty, but we need other tools to be installed so as to work swiftly on git. 


## Required Tools:

* Tortoise Git
* Putty
* Editor(Here we have Visual Studio Code and Notepadplusplus)
* Git
